			<h2 epub:type="title">Publisher’s Note</h2>
			<p>It gives us considerable pleasure to be able to offer to the public the “inside” record of those of former District Attorney Markham’s criminal cases in which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Philo Vance figured so effectively. The true inwardness of these famous cases has never before been revealed; for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> S. S. Van Dine, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vance’s lawyer and almost constant companion, being the only person who possessed a complete record of the facts, has only recently been permitted to make them public.</p>
			<p>After inspecting <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Van Dine’s voluminous notes, we decided to publish <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Benson Murder Case</i> as the first of the series⁠—not because it was the most interesting and startling, nor yet the most complicated and dramatic from the fictional point of view, but because, coming first chronologically, it explains how <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Philo Vance happened to become involved in criminal matters, and also because it possesses certain features that reveal very clearly <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vance’s unique analytic methods of crime detection.</p>
